## Project Overview

English | [PortuguÃªs](README_pt-br.md)

Welcome to our project, where we use Machine Learning algorithms to address a critical question: the detection of counterfeit currency.

### Data Sources

To tackle counterfeit currency detection, we make use of the "fake_bills_unsuperv" dataset, which is a variation of the "fake_bills.csv" dataset available on Kaggle.

### Approach

Our analysis utilizes a variety of powerful tools and libraries to extract insights from the data, including:

- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations and data handling.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For data visualization and charts.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms.

If you're interested in delving deeper into our analysis, feel free to explore the [Project](app.py). You can also try our app [HERE](https://fakebillprediction.streamlit.app/)!

If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to get in touch.

Thank you for visiting our project!
