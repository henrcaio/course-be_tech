## Project Overview

English | [PortuguÃªs](README_pt-br.md)

Welcome to our project, where we harness the power of Machine Learning algorithms to address a fundamental question: What characteristics make a song successful?

### Data Sources

We leverage the "dataset.csv" dataset, which contains Spotify's music data. You can find this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset).

### Approach

Our analysis employs a variety of powerful tools and libraries to extract insights from the data, including:

- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data handling.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning algorithms.

If you're interested in delving deeper into our analysis, feel free to explore the [Project Notebook](Projeto_ML2-1.ipynb).

We hope you find our exploration of what makes songs successful both informative and engaging. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting our project!
